## Meditation App built with Web Technologies and PhoneGap
This project represents an effort to build a Native Android Application using Web Technologies and Phonegap Cordova. 

## Motivation
I had to use PhoneGap to build a web application into a Native Android Application as a requirement for my Mobile App Development Class. I therefore choose to build an app on around something I have an interest in: Mindfulness Meditation. I engage in Mindfulness Meditation because of its immense benefits on my mind and general well being. I sought to create a meditation app that allows me to journal my thoughts and save them on the cloud as well as view audio and video meditations I like. 

## Built With 
* HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery Mobile) - Front-end Design and Client Side Interactions
* Firebase - For Storage and User Authentication
* PhoneGap and Cordova - To convert web app into Native Android App and to access hardware functionalities of Android phone
